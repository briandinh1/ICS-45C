Give an estimate of the relative efficiency of each of the following two assignments (I mean how many function calls, how many copies are made, etc): 
String s("Hello");
String t("There");
s = s + t;
s += t;


The way I have written my + and += operators makes the efficiency almost the same. 
However, s = s + t may be slightly slower, because the program has to make both a copy of s and t
In s+=t, the program just uses the s that already exists as 'this'. 
Once concatenated into a new list, that list is then copied over to whatever variable is on the left side.
